# Strengths & Accomplishments

## Strengths

Tip: Think about what your super powers are. How do you contribute to
the team's success?

- [**Communication**: It's everything in this job and so often lacking.
  Customers need advocates who are responsive and follow through with
  what they promise]{.mark}

- [**Process improvement**, (in many ways DevOps), and identifying
  actionable updates to improve a process]{.mark}

- [**Problem solving**: Working to fix the root cause]{.mark}

- [**Always learning new technologies and processes**, particularly
  those that help me to solve my current set of problems. I like to
  prototype and code, and with 20 years of experience, I think I'm very
  good and keeping designs/ process simple -- I do believe that most
  software products/ processes are much more complicated than they need
  to be]{.mark}

## Accomplishments

Tip: Focus on results (what), behaviors (how) , resulting impact (why
was it noteworthy). Also identify how you contributed to others
successes; how you built on others accomplishments.

1.  Build something to solve a problem that improved quality of life for
    others x 100

2.  Continuing to be technically curious and building and maintaining my
    open source projects

# Development Areas

Tip: Think about your areas of focus as you grow your career. Use
leadership principles and GitHub values as guides to establish areas of
focus.

1.  Finding opportunities to continue to push my Developer metrics ideas
    and grow

2.  Exposure to a number of situations to understand how customers think
    about DevOps and learning more about how to solve their 'ah-ha'
    moment to get and improve their DevOps maturity

# Development Actions

Tip: GitHub encourages actions to support the development area to follow
the 70/20/10 model where 70% of the actions or efforts on development
are on the job. 20% of it should come from learning from others and rest
through formal classroom (including virtual) learning.

### Learning on the Job:

- Continuing to engage with team members to understand their
  perspectives and share my own

### Learning from others:

- Continuing to discuss and debate software development process,
  technologies, and DevOps methodologies with anyone who will engage. Is
  Agile a failure? Why are so many enterprises so immature in their
  DevOps journey? Why is Git so popular and what is next? Will AI save
  the world - or destroy it?

### Learning thru classroom:

- Finding the right training that takes me to the next level - whether
  it's pursuing a phd, presenting at a conference, or spending time with
  high school/ college students. This is challenging at my current
  level, I need 300/400 classroom opportunities, and these are rare - I
  need to lean on learning day sessions and opportunities.
